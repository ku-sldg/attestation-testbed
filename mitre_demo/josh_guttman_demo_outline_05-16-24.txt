Consider a demo of the following form:

1.  Understory:  Protects the Attestation Mgr VM from the target VM,
    with AM to TVM inspection.

2.  AM periodically measures TVM kernel to establish Linux kernel with
    SELinux enabled, plus relevant properties of the SELinux policy.
    See below, (4).

    AM also ascertains that the TVM maintains a Collocated Attestation
    Mgr within TVM.

3.  AM delivers a Copland phrase to CAM causing it to measure a
    pipeline consisting of an Ingest Mgr; a Sanitizer; a
    Post-sanitizer Policy Checker; and an Emission mgr.

    We want to check code integrity about these components and
    possibly also control flow integrity or configuration data
    integrity.  

4.  The relevant properties of the SELinux policy are:

    (a) CAM is protected from non-CAM components;

    (b) Only the intended executable can transition into the domain
    for each of the intended pipeline stages;
    
    (c) Each pipeline component is the only component that can read
    files from its input directory; that can write files to its output
    directory; 

    (d) Only a manager component can list and delete files in those
    directories.
